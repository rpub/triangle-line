(make-point x-cor y-cor).
    This function needs to create a “list” that will have 
    two elements: x-cor and y-cor. 
    
    You will need to use the 'cons' function.
    
    Suggested: (get-x point)
                (get-y point)
                    using 'car' and 'cdr' functions

(is-line point1 point2 point3). 
    Using the created points (using make-point)... 
        true (#t) if the three points form a line 
        or false (#f) if they form a triangle.

(distance point1 point2). 
    Calculates the distance between two points

(perimeter point1 point2 point3). 
    Calculates the *perimeter* of a triangle defined by the three points

(area point1 point2 point3). 
    Calculates the *area* of a triangle defined by the three points

(calculate-triangle point1 point2 point3). 
    Using the 3points, Calculates:
        Perimeter 
        Area
        Interior angles
